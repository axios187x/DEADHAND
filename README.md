# DEADHAND
A standalone "Dead Hand" tripwire alarm for the M5Stack Fire. This project uses the device's built-in IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to detect movement and trigger an audible alarm. The alarm can only be disarmed by entering a pre-set code using the physical buttons. All triggered events are logged to a microSD card.

This is my first real repro. I will be adding functionalities through various other sensors as this develops
